          hi! I'm rachita.. i'm a React developer and love building websites. i
          began my web development journey more than 4 years back and have
          enjoyed every bit along the way. i'm always open to learning new
          things and i aim to get better at my skills everyday. i've built this
          website using vite, typescript and tailwind css.

          when i'm not working, i love to explore new places and food in my city
          and around. i like to read fiction, discover new music, art and movies
          :)
